| **Description** | In this project unsupervised learning was used to identify customer segments. < Short description to get an impression why this project was performed. >|
| **Anaconda environment** | < Which environment was used? > |
| **Data Set** | The data sets have been provided by Arvato through Udacity. It contains one data set with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. As the data sets ar **proprietary**, they cannot be added to the github repo. |
